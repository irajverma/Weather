# Weather Forecast App üå¶Ô∏è

A Python-based Weather Forecast App that provides real-time weather updates. This application allows users to enter a city name and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, and location details.

### Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Displays current temperature and weather conditions.
- **City Search**: Users can input any city name to retrieve weather information.
- **Simple GUI**: Built using Tkinter for an easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Customizable Background**: Option to set a background image.
- **Error Handling**: Alerts the user in case of invalid input or API errors.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language for the app.
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework to create the user interface.
- **Geopy**: For geocoding city names to latitude and longitude.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For handling background images.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Retrieves weather data based on city input.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/weather-forecast-app.git
   cd weather-forecast-app

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests geopy pillow
### 3. Get your OpenWeatherMap API key:

- Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get your API key.
- After signing up, navigate to the API section and generate a key.
- Replace the `api_key` in the Python script (`weather_app.py`) with your own API key.

### 4. Run the app:

To run the weather application, use the following command:

```bash
python weather_app.py
This is the proper markdown formatting:

- **Code blocks**: The command is enclosed in triple backticks (```bash) to indicate that it's a terminal/command-line instruction.
